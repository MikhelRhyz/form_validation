🧾 Form Validation

🚀 Features

Password strength indicator

Confirm password matching

Terms and conditions agreement checkbox

🧠 How It Works

The form includes fields for email, password, confirm password, and terms agreement.

Validation logic (to be implemented in JavaScript) ensures:

The email is properly formatted.

The password meets strength requirements (length, uppercase, special character, etc.).

Both passwords match.

The user agrees to the terms.
